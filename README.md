# *A customized Rprofile.site file for Microsoft Windows platform.*        
### *Tailored for Microsoft R open 4.0.2*
***Just replace the contents of the Rprofile.site file in `<parent directory>/<R install directory>/<R x.x.x>/etc` with Rprofile.R file provided here!.      
.R extension is used just to take advantage of syntax highlighting in editors.***   
***This is just a modified version of the vanilla Rprofile.site that comes with Microsoft R installations.       
This intends to eliminate certain unwanted configurations included for other platforms and to bypass the fixed CRAN mirror snapshots by hard coding a fairly recent date for the snapshot! (The default snapshot is from 2020 which is pretty archaic now!)***
